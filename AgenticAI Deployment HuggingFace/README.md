# 🤖 Agentic AI Flood Prediction System

Welcome to the **Autonomous Flood Prediction System** powered by multiple AI agents!

## 🎯 What This System Does

This is a cutting-edge **agentic AI system** that operates completely autonomously to predict flood risks. It uses multiple specialized AI agents working together to:

- 🔍 **Monitor** data quality and detect drift automatically
- 🧠 **Select** the best models using advanced optimization techniques
- ⚙️ **Engineer** features autonomously to improve predictions
- 📊 **Track** performance continuously and adapt to changes
- 🎯 **Make** intelligent decisions about deployment and retraining
- 🔄 **Operate** 24/7 without any human intervention

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🤖 Autonomous Agents
1. **Data Monitoring Agent** - Watches for data quality issues and drift
2. **Model Selection Agent** - Automatically finds the best ML models
3. **Feature Engineering Agent** - Creates new features to boost performance
4. **Performance Monitoring Agent** - Tracks model performance in real-time
5. **Decision Making Agent** - Makes smart deployment decisions
6. **Orchestrator** - Coordinates all agents seamlessly

### 🎮 Interactive Interface
- **🔮 Flood Prediction**: Get instant flood risk predictions
- **🤖 Autonomous AI**: Run the autonomous training cycle
- **📊 Dashboard**: View real-time system performance
- **ℹ️ About**: Learn how the system works

## 🌟 Why This Is Revolutionary

### Traditional ML Systems:
- ❌ Require manual model training
- ❌ Need human monitoring for performance
- ❌ Manual feature engineering
- ❌ Static and don't adapt to new data
- ❌ Require constant human intervention

### Agentic AI System:
- ✅ **Fully autonomous** - trains models automatically
- ✅ **Self-monitoring** - detects and fixes issues
- ✅ **Auto feature engineering** - discovers new patterns
- ✅ **Adaptive** - continuously learns and improves
- ✅ **Zero human intervention** - operates independently

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

The system is built using:
- **Python** with modern ML libraries (XGBoost, LightGBM, Optuna)
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
- **Asyncio** for concurrent agent execution
- **Gradio** for the interactive web interface
- **Plotly** for real-time visualizations
